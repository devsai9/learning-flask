This respository has three folders each with different projects to help me learn Flask and deploying AI models via Flask.<br>

The projects are:

- [MNIST Digit Identification [Tensorflow]](flask-with-tf/README.md)

To use any project follow the instructions in the respective README.md file (links in the bulleted list above).
